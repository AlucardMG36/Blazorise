<Paragraph>
    In this update, we're bringing many fixes for the v1.0 release. One of the most significant problems that are now fixed is the problem with caching of JS files that would have an invalid version, and then the older, unsupported version would be used by the browser.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Next, we fixed a long-standing problem with dropdowns inside a responsive table. This one was quite hard to do, but we managed it.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
    Overall, the new update is quite extensive and will bring more stability to Blazorise. Please update your projects and let us know if any problems arise.
